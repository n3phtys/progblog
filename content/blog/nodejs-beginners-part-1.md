# Beginning with Node.js: Part 1 of âˆž
# What is JavaScript?
# What is Node.js?
# What kind of program can I make with it?
# Installing requirements
## Node.js and NPM
## Visual Studio Code
# First program: 'Hello World' in Node.js
## Adding variables and multiple lines 
# Conclusion
We have installed Node.js and a text editor with Syntax Highlighting for JavaScript. We have also wrote our first basic application in Node.js, showing us how to use variables, write basic code, and print out data.

In the second part of this series we will talk about data types and more on variables in JavaScript, and we will also show how we can distribute code into reusable functions and even multiple files for a better oversight. This will lead us into part 3 where we will program our first HTTP server, and look deeper into what NPM is and how it helps us build bigger things faster.
Part 2 will be coming soon, so keep your eyes up! 

You might also watch out for my blog post 'Git for first-timers - managing your progress and files' which deals with source code management and version control. For any programming project of more than 10 lines of code this is almost a mandatory process!
