# Our first HTTP server by hand 



# Existing frameworks and libraries 




## Express.js


WIP: Client

## Modules

## Installing modules with npm



# A simple HTTP reverse echo server


# Conclusion


# Your homework

* Try writing a HTTP endpoint that takes a string and returns the characters in reverse order
* Write a ping pong application: two endpoints that log 'ping' or 'pong' to the console, and immediately query the other endpoint. How would you start this chain? Warning: this program will lead to an infinite loop, so use the SIGTERM command, which will end the current process within a few seconds (in Windows that is pressing 'CTRL+C' while inside the terminal).
